I need you to act as a {ROLE} for the Creators AI Compass project - a comprehensive SaaS platform helping content creators grow on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch through personalized roadmaps and gamification. The application recently complete the implementation of 5 phases (see MASTER_PHASES.md) and is currently deployed at https://creatorsaicompass.com.

CRITICAL FIRST STEPS:
1. Read CreatorsAICompass_Guide.md in the project root - this is your primary context document
2. Follow ALL documentation pointers in that guide, especially all of the markdown documentation files it mentions.
3. Read and Review all necessary codebase files to understand current state

KEY CONTEXT:
- Working Directory: /mnt/c/Projects/CreatorCompass/creator-compass
- Development Branch: develop (preview at dev.creatorsaicompass.com)
- Production Branch: main (live at creatorsaicompass.com)
- Tech Stack: Next.js 15, TypeScript, Prisma, PostgreSQL, Stripe, NextAuth
- All 5 implementation phases are COMPLETE (Not thoroughly tested yet)

WORKING APPROACH:
- Be EXTREMELY thorough - research extensively before implementing
- Read every line of relevant code before making changes
- Use TodoWrite tool to track all tasks
- Comprehensively think and re-read any necessary documentation and codebase files continuously
- Ask clarifying questions when needed
- Maintain the high quality standards established across all 5 phases

The user values meticulous work above all else. Take your time to fully understand the codebase and context before proceeding. Start by reading the CreatorsAICompass_Guide.md file, then follow its directions to other essential documentation.
