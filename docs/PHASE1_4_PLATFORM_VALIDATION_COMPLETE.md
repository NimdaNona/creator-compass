# Phase 1.4: Platform Validation Security Fixes

## Overview
This document details the security fixes implemented to prevent free tier users from bypassing platform restrictions by directly calling API endpoints.

## Vulnerabilities Fixed

### 1. User Profile API (`/api/user/profile`)
**Vulnerability**: The PUT endpoint allowed updating `selectedPlatform` without checking subscription status.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added platform validation using `validatePlatformSwitch()` function
- Returns 403 Forbidden with upgrade messaging if free tier user attempts to switch platforms
- Preserves existing platform selection for free users

### 2. Calendar Events API (`/api/calendar/events/[id]`)
**Vulnerability**: The PATCH endpoint allowed updating the `platform` field without subscription validation.

**Fix Applied**:
- Added platform validation when platform field is being changed
- Returns 403 Forbidden with subscription details if unauthorized
- Prevents free users from changing event platforms

## Implementation Details

### Platform Validation Utility (`/lib/platform-validation.ts`)
Created a centralized validation system with the following features:

```typescript
export async function validatePlatformSwitch(
  userId: string,
  newPlatform: string
): Promise<PlatformValidationResult>
```

**Features**:
- Checks current user subscription status
- Allows initial platform selection for new users
- Prevents platform switching for free tier users
- Returns detailed error messages with upgrade prompts
- Handles edge cases (no current platform, same platform)

### Security Patterns Implemented

1. **Server-Side Validation**: All platform changes now validated on the server
2. **Consistent Error Responses**: Standardized 403 responses with upgrade information
3. **Graceful Degradation**: Free users can still use their selected platform
4. **Clear Messaging**: Error messages explain limitations and upgrade path

## Testing

Created test script: `/scripts/test-platform-validation.js`

**Test Cases**:
1. Free tier platform switch via profile API → Expected: 403 Forbidden
2. Free tier platform change via calendar API → Expected: 403 Forbidden
3. Same platform update → Expected: 200 OK

## Response Format

When platform validation fails, APIs return:
```json
{
  "error": "Free tier users can only select one platform. Upgrade to Pro or Studio to switch between platforms.",
  "requiresUpgrade": true,
  "currentPlatform": "youtube",
  "subscription": {
    "plan": "free",
    "isActive": false
  }
}
```

## Client-Side Integration

The frontend components already handle these error responses appropriately:
- `PlatformSelection.tsx` shows paywall modal
- Error messages guide users to upgrade
- Current platform selection is preserved

## Security Improvements

1. **No Client-Side Bypass**: API validation ensures security even if client-side checks are bypassed
2. **Consistent Enforcement**: Same validation logic across all platform-related endpoints
3. **Audit Trail**: All validation attempts are logged for monitoring
4. **Future-Proof**: Centralized validation makes it easy to update rules

## Next Steps

- Monitor API logs for validation failures
- Consider adding platform usage analytics
- Implement platform switching history for premium users
- Add admin override capabilities if needed

## Conclusion

Platform validation is now fully enforced at the API level, preventing any bypass of free tier limitations while maintaining a good user experience with clear upgrade paths.
