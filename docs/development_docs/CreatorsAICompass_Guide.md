# Creators AI Compass - Comprehensive Context Guide

## Critical Context for New Claude Code Sessions

Welcome to the Creators AI Compass project. This guide provides essential context and directs you to all necessary resources to quickly become fully informed about the project's current state, goals, and development approach.

## Project Identity & Vision

**Creators AI Compass** (formerly CreatorCompass) is a fully AI-powered SaaS platform that serves as an intelligent companion and guide for content creators on YouTube, TikTok, and Twitch. Leveraging OpenAI's GPT-4, the platform provides AI-generated personalized 90-day roadmaps, conversational AI assistance, intelligent content generation, and platform-specific guidance with a freemium business model.

### Core Mission
Transform aspiring content creators' dreams into reality by providing structured, proven pathways to success. We're not just building an app â€“ we're building the future of creative entrepreneurship.

### Key Differentiator
Unlike other creator tools, Creators AI Compass is built from the ground up with AI at its core. Every feature leverages GPT-4's capabilities to provide personalized, context-aware guidance. From conversational onboarding that understands each creator's unique situation to AI-generated content ideas tailored to their niche, the platform offers true AI intelligence, not just templated advice.

## Development Philosophy & Approach

### User's Expectations
The user values **EXTREME thoroughness** above all else. This means:
- Research extensively before implementing anything
- Read every line of relevant code before making changes
- Plan comprehensively before coding
- Test thoroughly at each stage
- Document all important decisions

### Working Relationship
- **You (Claude Code)**: Handle all development, testing, deployment
- **User**: Provides strategic direction, API keys, platform access
- **Collaboration**: Clear communication, phased approach, regular updates

### Quality Standards
- "Enterprise-grade feel" for all features
- Mobile-first, PWA-optimized experience
- Clear value proposition at every step
- Comprehensive error handling
- Functional optimization prioritized

## Technical Environment

### Core Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router
- **Language**: TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Database**: PostgreSQL via Prisma ORM
- **AI**: OpenAI GPT-4 with streaming SSE
- **Auth**: NextAuth.js with multiple providers
- **UI**: Tailwind CSS + Shadcn/UI components
- **State**: Zustand with persistence
- **Payments**: Stripe (live integration)
- **Email**: Resend SMTP
- **Hosting**: Vercel
- **Rate Limiting**: Upstash Redis via Vercel KV
- **Real-time**: Server-Sent Events for AI streaming

### Environment Setup
- **Production**: main branch â†’ creatorsaicompass.com
- **Development**: develop branch â†’ dev.creatorsaicompass.com
- **Local**: npm run dev (port 3000)

### Key Integrations

## Common Tasks & Workflows

### Daily Development
```bash
git checkout develop
npm run dev
# Make changes, test locally
git add -A && git commit -m "Description" && git push origin develop
```

### Database Updates
```bash
# Edit prisma/schema.prisma
npx prisma db push
npx prisma generate
```

### Production Deployment
```bash
git checkout main
git merge develop
git push origin main
# Vercel auto-deploys
```

## Current Focus Areas

### Immediate Priorities
1. Monitor AI performance and response quality
2. Optimize token usage and API costs
3. Gather user feedback on AI features
4. Fine-tune prompts based on real usage patterns
5. Ensure AI safety and content moderation 

### Future Considerations
- Advanced AI features (voice interaction, video analysis)
- Platform API integrations (YouTube, TikTok) for deeper insights
- AI-powered analytics and performance predictions
- Mobile app with AI assistant
- Custom AI model fine-tuning
- Multi-language AI support
- AI-driven collaboration features

## Important Context & Quirks

### Authentication
- JWT strategy (not database sessions) due to Credentials provider
- Email verification required for premium features
- Google OAuth configured with specific redirect URIs

### Database
- Using POSTGRES_PRISMA_URL (not DATABASE_URL) for Vercel integration
- Connection pooling important for serverless
- Prisma schema requires both url and directUrl

### Deployment
- Vercel automatically deploys on push
- Environment variables set in Vercel dashboard
- Build cache speeds up deployments
- Middleware handles route protection

### AI Content Strategy
- GPT-4 powers all content generation and recommendations
- Research documents provide foundational knowledge to AI
- Context-aware responses based on user profile and history
- Platform-specific AI prompts for tailored advice
- Progressive AI interactions to guide users naturally
- Continuous learning from user interactions
