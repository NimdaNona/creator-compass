# Project Context & Important Details - Creators AI Compass

## User Context & Preferences

### Communication Style
- Wants extreme thoroughness and meticulousness
- Expects comprehensive research before implementation
- Values strategic planning and documentation
- Appreciates detailed progress updates
- Prefers phased approach to development

### Working Relationship
- User serves as "human bridge" for external platform access
- User handles: API credentials, platform configurations, strategic decisions
- Claude Code handles: All development, research, implementation, testing
- Collaborative approach with clear communication

### Key Directives
- "EXTREMELY thorough" - Research extensively before implementing
- Read every line of relevant code before making changes
- Use all available MCP servers (filesystem, brave-search, sequential-thinking)
- Document comprehensively for future reference
- Test thoroughly at each stage

## Project Background

### Origin Story
- Initially built as "CreatorCompass" by Claude Code
- Research docs were originally in .docx format (difficult to read)
- Converted to markdown for better accessibility
- Extracted content JSON files were created as workaround (can be deleted)
- Domain changed to include "AI" - creatorsaicompass.com

### Vision Evolution
- Started as creator growth platform
- Evolved to "Creators AI Compass" - fully AI-powered guide for content creators
- Successfully integrated OpenAI GPT-4 for intelligent features
- AI now powers conversational onboarding, content generation, and personalized guidance
- The "compass" metaphor fully realized with AI navigation

### Business Model
- Freemium SaaS model with AI usage limits
- Free tier: Single platform, 30-day roadmap, 50 AI chats/month, 10 content generations
- Premium tier: $9.99/month or $99/year
- Unlimited AI features behind paywall
- Email verification required for paid features

## Technical Quirks & Notes

### Authentication Specifics
- Google OAuth redirect URI: https://creatorsaicompass.com/api/auth/callback/google
- Email provider uses Resend SMTP (not traditional providers)
- Password reset tokens expire after 1 hour
- Email verification required before accessing paid features
- JWT strategy (not database sessions) due to Credentials provider

### Database Considerations
- Using Neon (Vercel Postgres) - connection pooling important
- Prisma as ORM - sometimes requires special handling
- Database in US East region
- Connection string includes pooler for better performance

### Deployment Specifics
- Vercel automatically deploys on git push
- Environment variables must be added via Vercel dashboard
- Preview deployments use 'development' environment
- Production uses 'production' environment
- Build cache helps with deployment speed

### Known Issues & Workarounds
- TypeScript strict mode can be challenging - use 'any' sparingly
- Some ESLint rules are overly strict (can disable if needed)
- Prisma generate runs automatically on install
- Service worker needs careful cache management
- React Server Components have hydration considerations
